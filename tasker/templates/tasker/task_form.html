 <p>Tasks are the core of each board. A task describes a specific action item which needs to be done. If a task can only be done by specific members of the team, you should note that right in the label of the task.</p>
 <p class="alert alert-info">Tasks will be given to the users independently, meaning each task must be doable regardless if other tasks have been done or not.</p>
